# Git_Practice

	Practice project for Git adding and commiting.

## Markdown Language

	Trying different Markdown ~syntaxes~ for practice.
	_is this italicised?_ or *is this in italics?*

### Lets try a list, shall we?
	```
	-My first bullet point
	-Should be in a greyed out box?
	-That will do it.
	```

Lets end the session with a quote:
>My my Miss American Pie,
>Something about a Chevy?
>Then a dry Levy?
**Xavier R**
***Tryning three asterisks***
